   - Provide instant messaging capabilities (Prosody XMPP, Synapse Matrix)
   - Handle voicemail processing and management

2. **Security & Reliability**
   - Implement robust security measures (Fail2ban)
   - Ensure high availability and fault tolerance
   - Protect user privacy and data
   - Secure all communication channels

3. **Accessibility**
   - Support speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion
   - Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies
   - Provide multiple ways to interact with the system

4. **Scalability**
