# Active Context: Project Ghost

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on establishing the Memory Bank documentation system for Project Ghost. This is the initial setup of the documentation framework that will serve as Cline's memory between sessions.

### Primary Activities

1. Creating the core Memory Bank structure
2. Documenting the existing system architecture and components
3. Establishing baseline documentation for future development
4. Setting up the project intelligence tracking (.clinerules)

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial setup of the Memory Bank, there are no previous changes to document. This represents the baseline state of the project documentation.

The Memory Bank has been created with the following core files:
- projectbrief.md - Defining core requirements and goals
- productContext.md - Explaining why the project exists and problems it solves
- systemPatterns.md - Documenting system architecture and component relationships
- techContext.md - Detailing technologies used and development setup
- activeContext.md (this file) - Tracking current focus and next steps
- progress.md - Will document what works and what's left to build

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Initial Documentation**
   - Finalize the progress.md file to document current project status
   - Create .clinerules file to capture project intelligence
   - Review all Memory Bank files for consistency and completeness

2. **System Assessment**
   - Perform a detailed review of each service's current state
   - Document service interactions and dependencies in more detail
   - Identify any gaps or inconsistencies in the current implementation

3. **Development Planning**
   - Prioritize next development tasks based on project goals
   - Identify potential improvements to the current architecture
   - Plan integration testing strategy for the various services

4. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Add more detailed documentation for each service
   - Create diagrams for complex interactions
   - Document API endpoints and interfaces

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Documentation Structure**
   - The Memory Bank structure has been established with core files
   - Additional documentation may be needed for specific services
   - Consider creating service-specific documentation in subdirectories

2. **Project Scope Definition**
   - The current documentation is based on the observed file structure
   - Further clarification may be needed on specific service purposes and interactions
   - The exact scope of features and capabilities should be refined

3. **Integration Strategy**
   - How the various services integrate needs further documentation
   - API contracts between services should be documented
   - Authentication and authorization flows need clarification

4. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Current deployment appears to be Docker-based
   - Production deployment strategy needs documentation
   - Scaling considerations should be addressed

5. **Testing Approach**
   - Testing strategy for the integrated system needs definition
   - Service-level testing approaches should be documented
   - Automated testing implementation should be planned

## Current Challenges

1. **System Complexity**
   - The system involves multiple communication protocols and services
   - Integration points between services need careful documentation
   - Ensuring consistent behavior across all communication channels

2. **Documentation Completeness**
   - Initial documentation is based on file structure analysis
   - More detailed information about service implementations is needed
   - Runtime behavior and interactions need observation and documentation

3. **Project Status Clarity**
   - Current state of implementation is not fully documented
   - Which features are complete vs. in progress is unclear
   - Testing status and known issues need documentation
