/**
 * This is a simple UDP listener that...
 * 	* Receives raw RTP packets
 *  * Strips off the the 12 byte RTP header
 *  * Swaps the byte ordering if the audio is SLIN
 *    (RTP SLIN is big-endian but most providers expect little-endian)
 *  * Writes the audio to a debug file path is provided.
 *  * Emits the 'data' event.
 *
 *  Datagram sockets don't normally implement streaming capabilities
 *  like piping but piping would be very handy to use with a speech
 *  provider.  Fortunately it's easy to just add the Stream 'pipe'
 *  method to the socket.  It listens for 'data' events and just writes
 *  the data out to the stream provided in the 'pipe' call.  The ari-transcriber
 *  passes the socket to the speech provider who makes that pipe call.
